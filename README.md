# fitting of solar flares

The previously prepared spectra of the considered solar flare were fitted in the 
XSPEC package with a time resolution of 256 ms and 1024 ms. Fitting was per￾formed in Python using the PyXspec, AstroPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib libraries. Two 
phenomenological models were used: a power law and a and a broken power law 
model. The preferred model was selected using the Fisher criterion.
